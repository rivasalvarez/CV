In order to compile you have to type "g++ main.cpp"
In order to run type "./a.out" after comipiling.

This Program starts with the main menu from there you can choose to go to 
part 1, 2, 3, by pressing the number, if you go into number 1 it goes into 
the gaussian smoothing menu and you can choose parts a,b,c,d. In order to 
go back to the main menu you have to press q. Option 2 asks for a threshold
and then writes all images. Option 3 asks for number of levels and steps, 
then writes each image with the name "lennaXX.pmg", where the first X is the
level, and the second X is the step.
